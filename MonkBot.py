"""
Welcome to your first Halite-II bot!

This bot's name is Settler. It's purpose is simple (don't expect it to win complex games :) ):
1. Initialize game
2. If a ship is not docked and there are unowned planets
2.a. Try to Dock in the planet if close enough
2.b If not, go towards the planet

Note: Please do not place print statements here as they are used to communicate with the Halite engine. If you need
to log anything use the logging module.

    for angular_step degrees difference, meaning that the algorithm will naively try max_correction degrees before giving
    up (and returning None). The navigation will only consist of up to one command; call this method again
    in the next turn to continue navigating to the position.

    :param game_map.Map game_map: The map of the game, from which obstacles will be extracted
    :param int speed: The (max) speed to navigate. If the obstacle is nearer, will adjust accordingly.
    :param bool avoid_obstacles: Whether to avoid the obstacles in the way (simple pathfinding).
    :param int max_corrections: The maximum number of degrees to deviate per turn while trying to pathfind. If exceeded returns None.
    :param int angular_step: The degree difference to deviate if the original destination has obstacles
